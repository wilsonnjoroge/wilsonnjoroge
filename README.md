## About Me

I'm a backend and enterprise middleware engineer with hands-on experience in Oracle SOA Suite, WebLogic, Service Bus, and cloud-native integration platforms. I understand how enterprise systems are designed, built, and operated at scale — and now I'm applying that foundation to security.

Currently pursuing an **MSc in Cyber Security and Digital Forensics**, I approach security not as a user of tools, but as someone who understands the systems being secured.

My background gives me a perspective most security practitioners don't have: I've built and integrated the kinds of enterprise systems that vulnerability assessments target. I know what's behind the services I'm scanning.

## Learning Philosophy

I'm building security expertise by following how attacks and defenses actually unfold — progressing through the complete lifecycle rather than jumping to exploitation:

```
┌─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│                  SECURITY LIFECYCLE                         │
├─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┤
│                                                             │
│  1. IDENTIFY → What's vulnerable and why?                   │
│     (Vulnerability Assessment & Management)                 │
│                                                             │
│  2. EXPLOIT → How are weaknesses actually attacked?         │
│     (Controlled Penetration Testing)                        │
│                                                             │
│  3. DETECT → How do we see attacks happening?               │
│     (SIEM/SOC & Security Monitoring)                        │
│                                                             │
│  4. PREVENT → How do we stop vulnerabilities at the source? │
│     (Application Security & Secure Development)             │
│                                                             │
│  5. SECURE → How do we architect secure environments?       │
│     (Cloud & Infrastructure Security)                       │
│                                                             │
│  6. RESPOND → How do we handle security incidents?          │
│     (Incident Response & Digital Forensics)                 │
│                                                             │
└─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

Each phase builds on the previous. This is how security programs mature — and how I'm structuring my learning.

## Projects

### Phase 1 — Vulnerability Assessment & Management
**Repository:** [vulnerability-assessment](https://github.com/wilsonnjoroge/vulnerability-assessment) | ✅ **Completed**

Comprehensive vulnerability assessment of intentionally vulnerable systems using enterprise-grade tools and methodology. Full 7-phase assessment lifecycle: pre-engagement through prioritised remediation reporting.

**What this demonstrates:**
- Cross-scanner validation (Nmap NSE + OpenVAS + Nessus + Nikto)
- CVE/CVSS analysis and risk prioritisation beyond raw scanner output
- Manual service enumeration across 13+ services
- Professional reporting: executive summary, technical report, attack chain analysis
- False positive identification and assessor judgement

**Completed target: Metasploitable2**
- 47 vulnerabilities identified across 23 services
- 14 Critical findings, 10 with confirmed public exploits
- 6 independent attack paths to full system compromise documented
- 4-scanner cross-validation with false positive assessment

**In progress:** DVWA, OWASP Juice Shop

### Phase 2 — Penetration Testing
**Repository:** [penetration-testing](https://github.com/wilsonnjoroge/penetration-testing) | 🗓 **Planned**

Controlled exploitation of validated vulnerabilities from Phase 1. Demonstrates the difference between theoretical vulnerability and confirmed exploitability — and what real-world impact looks like.

---

### Phase 3 — SIEM & Detection Engineering
**Repository:** [siem-detection-lab](https://github.com/wilsonnjoroge/siem-detection-lab) | 🗓 **Planned**

Detection rule development and log correlation using ELK Stack. Will use Phase 2 attack telemetry as the detection target — closing the loop between offensive findings and defensive visibility.

---

### Phase 4 — Application Security
**Repository:** [application-security](https://github.com/wilsonnjoroge/application-security) | 🗓 **Planned**

OWASP Top 10 analysis, threat modelling (STRIDE), and secure code review. Maps web vulnerabilities found in Phase 1 to root cause insecure coding patterns.

---

### Phase 5 — Cloud Security
**Repository:** [cloud-security](https://github.com/wilsonnjoroge/cloud-security) | 🗓 **Planned**

Cloud IAM hardening, container security, and IaC security on AWS, Azure, and Kubernetes.

---

### Phase 6 — Incident Response & DFIR
**Repository:** [incident-response](https://github.com/wilsonnjoroge/incident-response) | 🗓 **Planned**

Full incident response lifecycle from initial detection through forensic analysis and post-incident hardening.

---
